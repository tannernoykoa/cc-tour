#X text 5 28 "cymatics" is the pseudo-scientific practice of using
sound to promote health and healing in organic beings. the idea is
that sine waves of specific frequencies resonate inside the body in
such a way as to energize/activate various organs \, bodily functions
\, states of being \, emotions \, etc... by using cymatic frequencies
as signals \, rather than audio \, i attempt to embed their supposed
healing properties in other sounds. silent \, formless \, their resonance
penetrates the very nature of the sounds they modulate. in this way
\, music created with this system reappropriates and subverts themes
of "new age" music \, expanding the sound palette beyond the narrow
confines of ambient / minimalist.;

#X text 5 199 this patch uses cymatic frequencies to trigger envelopes
which \, in turn \, control a series of audio effects. the cymatic
abstraction receives input data from [sigmund~]. [sigmund~] \, in this
case \, monitors the amplitude from the incoming [adc~] audio: if the
signal is loud enough \, a randomly-selected cymatic frequency is triggered.
these frequencies are each associated with a specific parameter of
a specific effect. the effects are duplicated in stereo with independent
control \, so the resulting sound is best heard with headphones or
a pair of matching speakers.;
#X text 23 349 please open and explore these abstractions for more
info \, and credit where applicable.;
